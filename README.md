# Fifty-two Programming Problems Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to the programming problems from the book "Fifty-two programming problems" by Tamim Shariar Shubin.

## About

The book "Fifty-two programming problems" presents a collection of interesting programming challenges to help improve your coding skills. I've solved each problem using C/C++.

## Problems

1. [Problem 1](problem1.cpp) - Description of problem 1.
   - [Solution](problem1.cpp)
   
2. [Problem 2](problem2.cpp) - Description of problem 2.
   - [Solution](problem2.cpp)

   ... (continue for all 52 problems)

## How to Use

You can navigate to each problem's folder to view the problem description and solution code.

## Getting Started

If you want to try out these solutions, you can clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Fifty-two-programming-problems-solutions.git
```
Then, compile and run the C/C++ files using your preferred compiler.
